2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch
