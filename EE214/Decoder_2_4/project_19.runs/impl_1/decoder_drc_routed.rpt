2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_reg[0]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_reg[0]_i_1/O, cell led_reg[0]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_reg[1]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_reg[1]_i_1/O, cell led_reg[1]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_reg[2]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_reg[2]_i_1/O, cell led_reg[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_reg[3]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell led_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
